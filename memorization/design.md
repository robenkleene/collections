- **What are the intense bright blend modes, from least contrast to highest contrast?** Linear Light, Hard Light, Vivid Light, Pin Light (Long-Haired Vice President)

    ![Pin Light](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-pin-light.png)

- **What are the four tint blend modes, from lightest to darkest?** Overlay, Soft Light, Color, Hue (Open Sound Control Hardware)

    ![Soft Light](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-soft-light.png)
    ![Color](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-color.png)
    ![Hue](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-hue.png)

- **What is the difference between hard light and overlay blend modes?** Both use screen on light pixels and multiply on dark pixels, but overlay determines this using the base color and hard light uses the blend color (order hard liquor)

### Other

- **Vivid Light**: Color burn or color dodge based on the blend color ("Vi Vi" almost mark of the beast, for more extreme burning and dodging)

- **Hard Light**: Multiply or screen based on the blend color ("H" for "home", the default way of doing things)

    ![Hard Light](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-hard-light.png)

- **Soft Light**: Lightened like dodging or darken like burning based on the blend color ("S" for "special" and "spotlight")

    ![Soft Light](assets/blend-modes/blend-mode-soft-light.png)

- **Pin Light**: Darken and lighten simultaneously (Dark and light with a pin between them)
