## Scales

- **In music theory, what is the position of a note relative to the root called?** Scale degrees

- **In music theory, what are the minor keys of the circle of fifths in the flat (right) direction?** a, e, b, f#, c#, g#, d#
- **In music theory, what are the major keys of the circle of fifths in the sharp (left) direction?** C, F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭
- **In music theory, what are the minor keys of the circle of fifths in the sharp (left) direction?** a, d, g, c, f, b♭, e♭
- **In music theory, why is the circle of fifths called that?** Because each key to the right is a perfect fifth away from the previous key

## Intervals

- **In music theory, what is an interval?** The distance in scale degrees between two notes
- **In music theory, what is inverting an interval?** Moving the lower note up an octave, making it the higher note
- **In music theory, what is the rule of nines?** An interval and its inversion always add up to nine

- **In music theory, what is the inversion of a 3rd?** 6th
- **In music theory, what is the inversion of a 4th?** 5th
- **In music theory, what is the inversion of a 5th?** 4th
- **In music theory, what is the inversion of a 6th?** 3rd
- **In music theory, what is the inversion of a 7th?** 2nd
- **In music theory, what does diminished with intervals?** A half-step fewer
- **In music theory, what does augmented with intervals?** A half-step more
- **In music theory, how many scale degrees is a fifth?** Five
- **In music theory, what is the frequency ratio of a perfect fifth? `3:2`
- **In music theory, what are the perfect intervals?** Unison, Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, Octave
- **In music theory, what are the intervals that can be major or minor?** Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh
- **In music theory, what is the tonic?** The first note of a scale
- **In music theory, what is the difference between the major and minor intervals?** Major intervals have the tonic on the bottom, minor intervals have the tonic on top
- **In music theory, why are the octave and unison called perfect?** Because the pitch doesn't change
- **In music theory, all fourths and fifths are perfect except for those between which two keys?** F and B (the fourth has F on the bottom, the fifth has B on the bottom)
- **In music theory, why are the perfect fourth and perfect fifth called that?** Because those intervals have a high degree of consonance
- **In music theory, what happens to the frequency when you move a note up one octave in pitch?** The frequency doubles
- **In music theory, how many half steps is a perfect fifth?** Seven
- **In music theory, how many half steps is a perfect fourth?** Five
- **In music theory, how many half steps is an augmented fourth?** Six
- **In music theory, how many half steps is a diminished fourth?** Four
- **In music theory, what is the difference between an augmented fourth and a diminished fifth?** They're identical
- **In music theory, what is the tonic?** The first key of a scale
- **In music theory, what is the inflection of an interval?** Whether it's perfect, major, minor, augmented, or diminished
- **In music theory, how do you determine the type of interval?**
    1. Determine the difference in scale degrees 
    2. Remove all accidentals
    3. 8 is perfect octave
    4. 0 is perfect unison
    5. If the interval is a fifth, if it's between F and B, it's either an augmented fourth or diminished fifth, otherwise it's perfect
    7. If it's a second, third, sixth, or seventh, then if the top note is in the major key of the bottom note, it's major, otherwise if the bottom note is in the major key of the top note it's minor
    8. Add back the accidentals and determine if the interval is major, minor, augmented, or diminished (accidentals never change the distance of the interval, only the inflection)

### Chords

- **In music theory, what is a triad?** A chord with three notes
- **In music theory, what is tetrad?** A chord with four notes
- **In music theory, what is the lowest note in a chord when it is not inverted called?** Root
- **In music theory, what is a chord in when it is not inverted?** Root position
- **In music theory, what is a diminished triad?** A chord with two minor thirds
- **In music theory, what is a minor triad?** A chord with a major third on top of a minor third
