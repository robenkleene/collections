- **What is the Fermi paradox?** The contradiction between estimates of the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations existing, the their lack of evidence.
- **Where did Fermi problem get its name?** The physicist Enrico Fermi was known for making good approximate calculations based on little or no data, like estimating the strength of the Trinity test by dropping a piece of paper and seeing how far it moved.
