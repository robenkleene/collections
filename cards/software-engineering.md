- **What is `arm64`?** The 64-bit version of the ARM architecture
- **What is `AArch64`?** The 64-bit version of the ARM architecture
- **What is difference between `AArch64` and `arm64`?** They are the same thing
- **What is a CPU?** The part of a computer that executes instructions
- **What is a microprocessor?** A single chip CPU
