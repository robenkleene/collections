# Audio

## Theory

- **What is the Nyquist frequency?** The highest frequency that can be represented without distortion by a sampling rate
- **How do you calculate a Nyquest frequency?** Divide the sampling rate in half
- **How do you calculate a Nyquest rate?** Double the frequency
- **What is the Nyquist rate?** The sampling rate that can represent a frequency without distortion
- **Why is the Nyquist rate twice the highest frequency?** To represent a wave, two samples per cycle are needed
- **What happens to a frequency if it's above the Nyquist rate?** It becomes distorted with aliasing
- **What does sampling rate mean?** How many samples per second
- **What is the frequency range audible by humans?** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

## Guidelines

- **Why is the standard sampling rate 44.1 kHz?** Because it can represent the audible frequency range, with a little bit of additional headroom for aliasing
- **Which sampling rate is typically used for audio for video?** 48 kHz
- **Which sampling rate is typically used for audio for music?** 44.1 kHz

## Effects

- **What is a sampling delay?** A delay that's set in samples, rather than time or based on time signature
