# Audio

## Theory

- **What is the Nyquist frequency?** The highest frequency that can be represented without distortion by a sample rate, which is one half the sample rate
- **What is the Nyquist rate?** The sample rate that can represent a frequency without distortion, which is twice the frequency
- **Why is the Nyquist rate twice the highest frequency?** To represent a wave, two samples per cycle are needed
- **What happens to a frequency if it's above the Nyquist rate?** It becomes distorted with aliasing
- **What does sample rate mean?** How many samples per second
- **What is the frequency range audible by humans?** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

## Guidelines

- **Why is the standard sample rate 44.1 kHZ?** Because it can represent the audible frequency range, with a little bit of additional headroom for aliasing
- **Which sample rate is typically used for audio for video?** 48 kHz
- **Which sample rate is typically used for audio for music?** 44.1 kHz

## Effects

- **What is a sample delay?** A delay that's set in samples, rather than time or based on time signature
