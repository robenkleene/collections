# Photography

## Exposure

- **In photography, what does ISO stand for?** The International Organization for Standardization
- **In photography, what does ISO mean?** Light sensitivity
- **What are the four general ranges ISO can be broken into?**
    - 32--100: Lowest Noise
    - 100--400: Low Noise
    - 400--800: Medium Noise
    - 800--1600: High Noise
- **In photography, what is aperture? How does it effect light?** 
- **In photography, what is shutter speed? How does it effect light?** How long the shutter is open measured in fractions of a second, the longer the shutter is open, the more light is let in.
- **What is the relationship between stability and exposure?** The less stable you have to hold the camera, the noisier the image.
- **How do you increase stability by adding noise?** By increasing the ISO, which means the shutter speed can be decreased
- **How do you decrease noise by decreasing stability?** By decreasing the ISO, which means the shutter speed must be increased
- **Why shoot in manual mode?** When you want more control over the ISO value, in order to deliberately sacrifice stability in order to reduce noise

### AWB

- **What is AWB?** Auto White Balance
- **Why doesn't AWB matter when shooting RAW?** With the RAW file format the white balance can be adjusted later
- **When should you turn off AWB?** If your photo is too warm or too cool
- **Why is the white balance for cloudy orange?** Because light on a cloudy day is cool, so the cloudy setting warms it up
- **Why is the white balance for a light bulb blue?** Because light from a light bulb is warm, so the light bulb setting cools it down

## Focal Length

- **What is depth of field?** The distance between the nearest and farthest objects that are in focus
- **What is focal length?** The distance between where light convergence in the lens and the camera's sensor
- **What does focal length determine?** How wide a shot is
- **How is the zoom implementation different between a traditional camera and a mobile camera?** A mobile camera just crops in software, a traditional camera changes the focal length moving the lens
- **How does increasing the focal length change the shot?** The larger the focal length, the more magnified and narrower the shot

### Lens

- **In photography, what is an f-number or f-stop?** 
- **How does the focal length and aperture differ in a telephoto lens?** It has a large focal length
- **How does the focal length and aperture differ in a wide-angle lens?** It has a small focal length
- **What is an f-number?** Aperture relative to focal length
- **What does dividing the focal length by the aperture calculate?** The diameter of the aperture
- **What happens when you increase the f-number?** The aperture gets smaller
- **How does f-number affect depth of field?** A higher f-number means a deeper depth of field
- **How does f-number affect exposure?** A smaller f-number means a higher exposure

## iPhone

- **What is the aperture of an iPhone X?** f/1.8
- **How many cameras does the iPhone X have? What are they?** Two, a wide angle and telephoto camera
- **What kind of additional camera does the iPhone 12 have over the iPhone X?** Ultra wide
- **In photography, what is HDR?** Taking several photos at different exposures and combining them to get a more balanced result
- **What is the focal length of an iPhone X?** 28 mm
