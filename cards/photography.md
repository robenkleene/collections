- **In photography, what is ISO? How does it effect light?** Light sensitivity
- **In photography, what is aperture? How does it effect light?** 
- **In photography, what is shutter speed? How does it effect light?** How long the shutter is open measured in fractions of a second, the longer the shutter is open, the more light is let in.
- **What is the aperture of an iPhone X?** f2.2
- **What is the focal length of an iPhone?** 4.25mm
- **What does an aperture of `f2.2` mean?**
- **What does a focal length of 4.15mm mean?**
- **What is a wide-angle lens?**
- **What is a full-frame lens?**
- **What is depth of field?**
- **What is zone of sharpness?**
- **In photography, what is HDR?** Taking several photos at different exposures and combining them to get a more balanced result
- **Why should you shoot exposure manually, rather than using automatic brightness?** Because if you can see the ISO value, you can make more informed choices about the amount of noise being introduced
- **What is AWB?** Auto White Balance
- **Why doesn't AWB matter when shooting RAW?** With the RAW file format the white balance can be adjusted later
- **When should you turn off AWB?** If your photo is too warm or too cool
- **Why is the white balance for cloudy orange?** Because light on a cloudy day is cool, so the cloudy setting warms it up
- **Why is the white balance for a light bulb blue?** Because light from a light bulb is warm, so the light bulb setting cools it down

The less noisy you want your image, the more stable you have to hold the camera (so to get higher quality images, increase stability, which means you can reduce the shutter speed and increase the ISO, otherwise you need to increase the shutter speed and reduce the ISO, which introduces noise).
