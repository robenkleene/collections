Computing, by contrast, was young and explosive, driven forward as though by a series of pistol shots, every technological innovation inspiring a headlong leap ahead.

Instead of garnering praise and encouragement he was ordered to abandon his research and threatened with the loss of his lab assistants. His bosses hinted that his future at Xerox would be bleak if he failed to redirect his energies back to the pressing issues of lenses and white light.
