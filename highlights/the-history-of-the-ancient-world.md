> We have no idea. But Snefru’s new smooth-sided pyramid became known as the Bent Pyramid for the unfortunate reason that Snefru still hadn’t quite managed to figure out the angles. The pyramid was to have smooth and very steep sides—but partway through the construction, Snefru and his chief of works seemed to realize that their measurements were off. If the pyramid continued up at its current steep angle, the weight

`1693`:

> The Northern Pyramid, which stands a little more than a mile north of the Bent Pyramid, was wider, broader, and shorter than the pyramids which came before. The Bent Pyramid had shifted its steep angle from 52 degrees to a more gradual 43 degrees; the Northern Pyramid was designed from its conception with sides that sloped at a 43-degree angle. In this last attempt, Snefru’s design was so well planned that even now, over four thousand years later, no cracks have appeared in the walls or ceilings of the chambers that lie beneath two million tons of stone weight.

`1708`:

> According to Herodotus, Khufu reigned for fifty years. Egyptologists reckon on a reign about half this long, but twenty-five years was long enough for him to begin the biggest building project in history. His pyramid, the Great Pyramid, was laid out with a full complex, based on Snefru’s perfected designs: the pyramid itself, a causeway leading down to a valley temple, a temple for offerings to the east, and three smaller pyramids, probably for Khufu’s queens.

`1711`:

> The pyramid, built in a new location, on the Giza plain, peaked at 481 feet. Its slope is 51º52´, sharper than Snefru’s successful Northern Pyramid but not quite as steep as the failed Bent Pyramid; Khufu’s chief of works had benefited from the example of his predecessors. The sides of the Great Pyramid are remarkably even; each is right around 755 feet long, and even with the others to within 8 inches. The northern shaft that gives onto the King’s Chamber was designed to point to the Pole Star.

`1724`:

> But the tradition of Khufu’s evil, which echoes down from more than one source, is an interesting one. To build his monument—a stone structure with something like two and a half million blocks of stone in it, each block an average weight of two and a half tons—Khufu mobilized one of the largest work forces in the world. Even if the laborers were not reduced to abject slavery, the king’s ability to recruit such an enormous number of workers keenly illustrated his ability to oppress his people. The pyramids themselves stand as signposts to that power.

`1730`:

> One particularly acid story related by Herodotus tells us that Khufu, running low on funds and needing to raise a little more money, installed his daughter in a room with orders to entertain any men who might want to visit her and pass the cash along to him; she did so, but told every man, as he left her, to pile a stone at the worksite for her. The result was the middle Queen’s Pyramid, which stands near the Great Pyramid and which would have represented some kind of world record of courtesanship.8

`1755`:

> It is true that the Egyptians were not inclined to abstract mathematical thought. However, sighting the straight lines of a pyramid’s base is not that complicated a task; it requires competent calculation, but not a grasp of higher mathematical concepts. The task of moving the huge blocks is an enormous one, but this, again, was a merely mechanical difficulty. Herodotus says that the blocks were hauled up earthen ramps, a task which is far from impossible; experiments have shown that a hundred men are capable of lifting a two-and-a-half-ton block of stone with a papyrus rope,12 particularly if balls of the hard mineral dolomite are slid beneath the stone to act as rollers.

`1964`:

> Whatever Sumerian weaknesses played into the conqueror’s success, the outcome was a new thing. Sargon did what no Sumerian king had yet done successfully; he turned a loose coalition of cities into an empire.

`2001`:

> Keeping control of this vast expanse of land required a standing army; the men who “ate bread” in Sargon’s presence daily may have been the first professional soldiers in history.

`2111`:

> Khafre, Herodotus tells us, “carried on in the same manner” as his father. Like Khufu, he spent so much energy in building that he neglected the gods and did not reopen the sanctuaries. “The Egyptians loathe Chephren [Khafre] and Cheops [Khufu] so much that they really do not like to mention their names,” Herodotus adds.1 Whatever severe measures Khufu had resorted to in the building of his pyramid were repeated in the reign of his son. Khafre’s own pyramid, the so-called Second Pyramid, was only thirty-four feet shorter than the Great Pyramid. But Khafre built it, craftily, on higher ground, so the casual spectator is tricked into thinking that the Second Pyramid is taller.

`2117`:

> He also left another spectacular monument: the Sphinx, a mysterious limestone sculpture, part lion and part falcon, with a man’s face (probably a portrait of Khafre himself, although there is still plenty of argument over this point). The huge creature gazes to the east. It is usually referred to as a statue made from “living rock,” which simply means that it was carved on a piece of rock already sticking out of the ground, rather than constructed elsewhere and moved into place.

`2135`:

> Herodotus tells us that, according to Egyptian tradition, Menkaure reopened Egypt’s temples and sanctuaries, raised the people from the misery which his predecessors had inflicted on them, and ruled them kindly.42 Menkaure’s pyramid stands as additional proof of change: the Third Pyramid is only 228 feet tall, half the size of Khufu’s. It still required vast use of resources, but nothing like the lifetime of man-hours demanded by the previous pyramids.

`2144`:

> It was also lasting. The huge Fourth Dynasty pyramids, which have come to represent all of Egyptian history for so many students, stand as historical curiosities in the Egyptian landscape; no later pharaoh ever topped them. The pharaohs had tested the limits of their divine authority, and had come to the end of it. Menkaure could not compel the same unquestioning service as his father and grandfather.

`2191`:

> In other words, power was shifting from the palace towards the temples. The Fifth Dynasty pharaohs—there were probably nine, all of them more or less undistinguished—built very small pyramids, but during this century five new temples were built to the sun-god. The first was erected by Userkaf himself; a boat for Ra’s use lies at its south edge, and it boasted in front of it an obelisk, a stone tower pointing upwards at the sky, the home of Ra. The top of the obelisk was a miniature pyramid covered in gold that glowed in the rays of the sun like a miniature sun itself.
