"I’d estimate at least half of my frustrations with others are actually frustrations with myself for failing to set clear boundaries and stand by them."---[James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1296429807232864257)

"The problem with big bets is they are expensive and difficult to reverse.

The problem with small bets is that “light and quick” experiments rarely get your best effort. It’s hard to determine if it’s a good idea if you are half-assing it.

Small bets, full effort."-[James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1359997040084803584)
