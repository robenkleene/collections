# Adam Smith

"We see frequently the vices and follies of the powerful much less despised than the poverty and weakness of the innocent. To deserve, to acquire, and to enjoy the respect and admiration of mankind, are the great objects of ambition and emulation."-Adam Smith, the Theory of Moral Sentiments
