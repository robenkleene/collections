> I HAVE dedicated my life to the kitchen. I knew that if I wanted to be a
> successful chef, if I were to be truly passionate about my craft, this was the
> only way. People in our industry talk about how hard it is to succeed in this
> business, but you don't actually know horw hard it is until you're really, truly
> in it.
> 
> I still work very long hours. For years when I was starting out, when I was an
> apprentice, I made very little money-just enough to survive. I remember the
> physical pain of those years: my burning feet and my aching back. My forearms
> were crisscrossed with burns, my fingers nicked from my knives.
> 
> I missed weekend parties and the birthdays of my friends and family. No one even
> thought to invite me on snowboarding trips or to barbecues. My answer woukd
> always be, "No, I'm working." I spent the stroke of midnight every single New
> Year's Eve in the depths of a challenging service. Holiday dinners? These were
> with my team, eaten standing up, hovering over the sink, with minutes to spare
> before the night of work ahead. There was no time to give my mom a ring on
> Mother's Day-brunch was too busy. My relationships became second to the job, and
> they suffered. Lovers fell asleep waiting for me to return home at night. When I
> finally did make it through the door, I was emotionally and physically spent,
> smelling of fish and fryer oil and hours of stale sweat.
> 
> I did not have time to read bedtime stories to my children, and the number of
> years when they still want me to are quickly dwindling away. I am divorced. I
> still work late, I still work weekends, and I still hurt.
> 
> All this is true. But when one is attempting to do great things, when has it
> eter been easy? Why should we expect it to be any other way, in the kitchen or
> anywhere else in our lives? There is no great- ness without sacrifice. To be a
> great doctor, writer, musician, athlete to be the best in any field requires an
> incredible amount of work and commitment. The word for passion in German is
> Leidenschaft. The literal translation is "enjoy suffering." I think I understand
> what this means: if you are truly passionate about something, you must ask
> yourself if you're willing to suffer for it. If you are willing, then you know
> you are passionate. Otherwise it is just a hobby.
> 
> A dish like this is drawn from the long hours and years in the kitchen; I took a
> small piece from each restaurant, each mentor, to become the chef I am today.
> Without my myriad experiences and struggles, I could not create or execute the
> food I do. There are no steps to skip.
